LispKit system distribution `tape'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains the software described in `The LispKit Manual', 
Programming Research Group technical monograph PRG-32 (1983).  It is
(as far as I can determine after all these years) a copy of the tape 
described in the `Digital Equipment VAX machines' section at the back
of the manual.

LispKit is an implementation of a very small pure-functional language
with a LISP-like syntax.  It is described in the textbook

	Peter Henderson,
	`Functional Programming -- Application and Implementation',
	Prentice Hall International, 1980

and in more detail in

	Peter Henderson, Geraint Jones, Simon Jones,
	`The LispKit Manual',
	Programming Research Group technical monograph PRG-32 (2 vols),
	Oxford University Computing Laboratory, 1983.
		

Contents of the tape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        The files on the tape are essentially as described in the 
LispKit manual, in the section about VAX tapes:

        <name>.LSO, <name>.LOB, <name>.CLS, <name>.LIB

                these files contain the sources and codes of LispKit programs

        <name>.PAS, <name>.MAR

                these files contain the Pascal and Macro-11 sources for the
                virtual machines that run on the VAX

        <name>.COM

                are VAX DCL (job control) files included for guidance

        <name>.TXT

                these files are for reading - they include this one, and
                the sources of the reference machine, and of various
                machine specific input/output parts, included for the 
                guidance of anyone who wants to reimplement the system

        <name>.68k

                if these files occur on your tape, then they contain
                the source of a M68000 implementation of the virtual 
                machine - more details in README68k.TXT
